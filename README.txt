THIS MOD IS INCOMPLETE, EXPECT MANY BUGS AND MISSING FEATURES. 
THIS .ZIP FILE IS ALSO NOT THE MOD, THIS IS JUST THE SOURCE FILE AND WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT BUILDING IT INTO A .JAR FILE
IF YOU ARE CONFUSED WHY SOME ORES DONT SMELT, ITS BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY BE BLASTED

tags can be found in src/main/java/ro/srth/oretopia/util/oretopiaTags.java if you want to read for compatability

i suck at texturing so @Rockblend1 on twitter will be texturing some items

i am not the best at java as this is more of a test project to see how far i can go as i have recently started java and github in general, so if you have some java knowledge and you encounter a problem feel free to introduce your own fix and submit a pull request

please be aware that this mod does not use the official mappings but instead the version 20210309-1.16.5, and the mod id and display name when hovering over a item from the mod are different aswell. the hold shift for more info tooltip is also one tooltip is shared, meaning editing the tooltip that has the value "default" will change all items using the tooltip, if you want to change this, go to ModItems.java and in the else statment in the tooltip.add section of any item and change the default value to whatever you please, make sure to change the en-us json file aswell when adding new tooltips

this is probably common with other mods, but if you are editing the en_us json file do not delete the ยง symbol or the first letter that comes after it unless you want to change the color/format, good luck reading formating like the romium info tooltip lmao

mod was made in intelij idea community edition, ensure you have gradle installed if you want to edit this mod
